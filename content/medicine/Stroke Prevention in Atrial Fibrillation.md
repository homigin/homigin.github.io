## Prevalence of Af in Asia

  + 亞洲台灣地區在2020年的 Afib 患病率約為1.5％，預計到2050年將達到4.0％。

亞洲的 Afib 患病率正在增加，可以使用多種評分方案（例如C2HEST 和 Taiwan AF scores）來預測亞洲患者發生房顫的風險。
![https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2772374722001661-gr1.jpg](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-s2772374722001661-gr1.jpg)

## Assessment/re-Assessment of Stroke and Bleeding Risks

  + 亞洲Afib 患者每年中風風險約為3.0%

  + 對於亞洲房顫患者，我們建議使用CHA2DS2-VASc和HAS-BLED評分來評估中風和出血風險。

  + 對於CHA2DS2-VASc評分男性≥1分，女性≥2分的亞洲房顫患者，應提供口服抗凝藥物。

  + 患者年齡增長和併發症的發生會使中風和出血風險發生變化，因此，CHA2DS2-VASc和HAS-BLED評分應定期重新評估，最好在每次看門診時進行評估。

    + 亞太地區心律協會(APHRS)建議：中風風險應定期重新評估
（至少每年一次，如有可能，每4個月一次）。

  + 強調高HAS-BLED評分不應成為不給房顫患者處方或停用口服抗凝藥物的原因。

    + HAS-BLED評分≥3的 afib 患者，使用口服抗凝藥物與缺血性中風、顱內出血或死亡的綜合不良事件風險較低（4.19/100人年 vs 5.22/100人年，調整HR：0.781，P = 0.04）。

    + 對於baseline HAS-BLED評分為0-2且增加到≥3的服用抗凝藥物的房顫患者，繼續使用口服抗凝藥物與更好的臨床結果相關。

    + HAS-BLED score 可以幫助醫生識別和糾正可改變的出血風險因素，對正在抗凝治療的房顫患者進行干預。

## ABC Pathway

![https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2772374722001661-fx1.jpg](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-s2772374722001661-fx1.jpg)

  + ABC pathway - 較低的 all-cause death, cardiovascular death, stroke, and major bleeding 風險

    + Lower rates of composite outcomes and re-hospitalization.

  + Consensus

    + 推薦採用基於 ABC 路徑的整合護理或整體管理方法，以改善亞洲房顫患者的結果：

      + A = 抗凝治療  **anticoagulation**: 
well-managed warfarin (time-in-therapeutic-range >65% to 70%) or NOAC.

      + B =  更好的症狀管理 **Better** symptom management: 
患者為中心的症狀導向決策，包括心跳或心律控制（rate/ rhythm）。

      + C = 心血管風險和共病管理 **Cardiovascular** risk and **comorbidity**  
(控制血壓，心衰，心臟缺血，睡眠呼吸暫停) 以及生活方式的改變（減肥，定期運動，減少酒精/興奮劑的使用，減輕心理病理等）

## Role of Wafarin

  + 在預防中風方面，Warfarin的效果在西方患者中的研究比在亞洲患者中更為充分。

  + 由於基因差異，亞洲患者很難達到2.0至3.0的最佳INR（國際標準化比值）。

  + 盡管試驗中觀察到的INR水平較低，亞洲患者使用Warfarin仍更容易出現出血問題。

  + 根據NOAC（非維生素K拮抗劑口服抗凝藥物）試驗的數據，對於亞洲房顫患者，預防中風時應優先選擇NOACs而非Warfarin。

  + Warfarin should not be the first-line therapy for stroke prevention in AF except when NOACs are contraindicated.

  + Well-controlled warfarin with adequate time-in-therapeutic range (>65% to 70%) may still be an option in some Asian patients when NOACs are not affordable.

## Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Drug Interaction of NOACs

  + P-glycoprotein pathway is of particular clinical relevance because of its inhibition by drugs commonly co-administered in AF patients.

  + strong inducers of P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P-450 3A4, such as rifampicin and St John’s Wort, should be used with caution as they may result in reduced plasma levels of the NOACs

## Dose-Reduction Criteria of NOACS for AF

  + ABCD rule

  + |  | Dabigatran (Either 1 of the Following) | Rivaroxaban | Apixaban (≥2 of the Following) | Edoxaban (≥1 of the Following) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Age** (≥80 y) | yes |  | yes |  |
| **B**ody weight (≤60 kg) | yes |  | yes | yes |

# Major NOAC Trials

![https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2772374722001661-gr3_lrg.jpg](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-s2772374722001661-gr3_lrg.jpg)

  + For Asian patients, NOACs are more effective and safer than warfarin in stroke prevention for AF.

## NOAC choice for asians

  + No head-to-head comparison among 4 NOACs.

  + Dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban 5 mg, edoxaban 60 mg, and edoxaban 30 mg is superior than warfarin in primary safety or efficacy endpoints.

  + Rivaroxaban 20 mg: non-inferiority to warfarin in both efficacy and safety.

  + Rivaroxaban 20 mg had similar effects to warfarin in major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke in Asian patients.

  + {{< logseq/mark >}}we recommend label-adherent dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban as initial NOAC choices.{{< / logseq/mark >}}

## CAD patients

  + Adding single antiplatelet therapy to OAC increases major bleeding risk by 60%-70%.

  + Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) increases bleeding risk by 130%.

  + Bleeding after PCI is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.

  + 怕出血，又要保持效果。

4 trials focused on AF patients undergoing PCI.

  + ### ACS undergoing PCI

    + **Rivaroxaban** doses in the PIONEER AF-PCI trial (2.5 mg BID and 15 mg QD)were unproven for stroke prevention in AF.

    + AUGUSTUS trial: aspirin vs placebo and showed lower bleeding with apixaban vs VKA

      + Apixaban+placebo 比 aspirin alone, VKA alone 或是 VKA+aspirin 或 apixaban+aspirin 更安全 (less bleeding, fewer hospitalizations)

      + ischemic events was similar across the different regimens

    + Dual therapy with a NOAC + P2Y12 inhibitor reduced bleeding risk compared to triple therapy (warfarin + aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor)

    + Meta-analyses suggest small increases in coronary events and stent thrombosis when omitting aspirin.

    + Aspirin use should be guided by bleeding risk, continuing for up to 1 month for low risk (HAS-BLED <3)and up to 1 week for high risk. (HAS-BLED score ≥3)

    + Dual therapy with NOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor should persist for 6 to 12 months after PCI.

    + After 1 year, NOAC alone is recommended based on the Japanese AFIRE trial.

    + {{< logseq/mark >}}Clopidogrel is the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor, while prasugrel and ticagrelor have limitations in AF patients.{{< / logseq/mark >}}

      + Ticagrelor: limited to patients with high thrombotic risk, such as in patients with ACS and complex PCI

      + Aspirin should be discontinued when combining ticagrelor with NOAC after the peri-PCI period.

  + Triple therapy : NOAC, clopidogrel, and aspirin

  + AF and ACS 做 PCI

    + HAS-BLED>=3: Triple therapy 1週, NOAC + clopidogrel 6M, 之後NOAC

    + HAS-BLED<3: Triple therapy 1M, NOAC + clopidogrel 1Y, 之後NOAC

  + Elective PCI 或 Medical treatment: Triple therapy 1週, NOAC + clopidogrel 6M, 之後NOAC

  + AF + chronic coronary syndrome after more than 1 year post-PCI: monotherapy with NOAC

  + Use approved stroke-preventive doses of NOACs (rivaroxaban 20 mg, dabigatran 110/150 mg, apixaban 5 mg, edoxaban 60 mg), following dose-reduction criteria.

  + Prasugrel is not included in triple or double therapy.

  + Ticagrelor use should be limited to high thrombotic risk cases.

## Patients with Valvular Heart Diseases

  + NOACs are contraindicated in patients with mechanical valves and moderate to severe mitral stenosis.

    + Mechanical valves : RE-ALIGN trial

    + Mod to severe MR: the Framingham study

      + 但目前重新討論中，有新的trial 在做

        + DAVID-MS：dabigatran
RISE MS： Rivoraxaban
INVICTUS-VKA

  + For patients with other valvular heart diseases, we recommend dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban as initial choices.

    + High-dose NOACs are more effective than warfarin in reducing stroke, but major bleeding risk is similar.
Rivaroxaban showed increased major bleeding compared to warfarin.

      + *J Am Coll Cardiol, 69 (11) (2017), pp. 1363-1371*

  + Bioprosthetic valves: edoxaban. - ENGAGE AF

  + AF patients undergoing TAVI, OAC alone is indicated unless there is a recent PCI (<3 months) indicating that dual therapy with OAC plus clopidogrel may be needed.
*Eur Heart J, 42 (23) (2021), pp. 2265-2269*

    + Edoxaban was non-inferior to VKAs in AF patients after TAVI. 
*N Engl J Med, 385 (23) (2021), pp. 2150-2160*

## Patients with a History of Stroke/ICH

  + ### AF-related ischemic stroke

    + AHA 2018 guideline: start OAC **4 to 14 days after the onset of ischemic stroke**

    + NOAC can be (re)initiated 1 day following a transient ischemic attack, but this is best prolonged to 14 days following a severe stroke.

    + NOACs are preferred over VKA in the secondary prevention of AF-related stroke.

  + ### Management of acute ischemic stroke while receiving OACs

    + Recurrent ischemic stroke while on NOAC: **thrombolytic therapy should not be given within 48 hours after the last dose of NOAC.**

    + **Dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab** allows for thrombolysis in selected patients.

    + Factor Xa inhibitors + 正常腎臟功能患者吃藥 24 to 48 hours 後 or 吃藥4小時後 plasma 濃度 <30 ng/mL, thrombolysis may be given in highly selected patients.

    + VKA and INR <1.7, thrombolysis may be considered according to neurological indication.

    + In other situations, endovascular thrombectomy may be provided if indicated.

    + {{< logseq/mark >}}For Asian AF patients, dabigatran 150 mg{{< / logseq/mark >}} may be considered in patients with recurrent ischemic stroke despite on other NOACs or with good anticoagulation control with VKA.

      + {{< logseq/mark >}}**Dabigatran 150 mg** is the only NOAC that reduces both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke compared to VKA in Asia{{< / logseq/mark >}}

  + ### Management of AF patients with a history of ICH

    + Initiation of OAC should be individualized - Major NOAC trials exlude ICH patients

    + NOACs should be the preferred option because there is a lower risk of ICH

    + {{< logseq/mark >}}NOAC may be started 2 weeks after ICH with high risk for ischemic stroke and low risk for recurrent ICH{{< / logseq/mark >}}

      + 2021 European practical guide: start NOAC {{< logseq/mark >}}4-8wk after ICH{{< / logseq/mark >}}
*Europace, 23 (10) (2021), pp. 1612-1676*

    + **Left atrial appendage occlusion** may be considered in patients with recurrent
ICH under NOACs or are contraindicated for NOACs.

      + 2020 ESC guideline *Eur Heart J, 42 (5) (2021), pp. 373-498*

## NOACS in Elderly Patients

  + Asian real-world evidence: NOACs are preferable to warfarin even in elderly patients.

  + For elderly AF patients, we recommend dabigatran 110 mg, apixaban, and edoxaban as initial choices.

    + J-ROCKET AF, ROCKET AF：rivaroxaban more bleeding

    + Underdosing of NOACs is more common in Asian countries and is associated with higher mortality. (GARFIELD-AF, ANAFIE registry)
Even in elderly patients, on-label doses of NOAC should be prioritized for stroke prevention.

  + Edoxaban 15 mg may be a possible choice when on-label doses are ineligible or no OAC use is considered in elderly fragile patients at high bleeding risk. (still have higher GI bleeding rate)

    + ELDERCARE-AF trial

## Patients With CKD

  + AF and CKD increase risk for thromboembolism and bleeding events.

  + NOAC efficacy and safety were consistent in different ranges of renal function

    + Apixaban performed better on safety endpoints in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min

  + Renal function should be monitored using the Cockcroft-Gault equation

    + detect worsening renal impairment

    + modify NOAC doses appropriately

  + Mild to moderate CKD (CrCl 30-49 mL/min): apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg, edoxaban 30 mg, and rivaroxaban 15 mg.

  + Severe CKD (CrCl 15-29 mL/min): apixaban 2.5 mg and edoxaban 15 mg

    + Major NOAC trials excluded patients with severe CKD and ESRD, except for the ARISTOTLE trial ： extended enrollment to patients with CrCl ≥25 mL/min.

    + **Dabigatran should not be used in patients with severe CKD** as its renal clearance is about 80%

    + ELDERCARE-AF: edoxaban 15mg reduced risk for primary composite efficacy endpoints (stroke, systemic embolization, and cardiovascular death) (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19-0.61; P < 0.001) and a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 0.90-3.89; P = 0.09)

  + ESRD: No data to support the use of warfarin or NOACs

  + {{< logseq/mark >}}Edoxaban can be safely used in patients with CrCl >95 mL/min.{{< / logseq/mark >}}

    + FDA recommended that edoxaban should not be used in CrCl >95ml/min - based on data from the ENGAGE-AF

      + risk for stroke or systemic embolization was numerically higher for edoxaban 60 mg vs warfarin (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.88-2.10; *P* = 0.17)

    + Efficacy in reducing stroke or systemic embolization with edoxaban was consistent across different ranges of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the RE-LY trial. eGFR ≥80 mL/min效果也ok

    + The risk for bleeding was significantly lower with edoxaban 60 mg compared to warfarin in patients with eGFR >95 mL/min, favoring edoxaban in terms of net clinical benefit. Circulation, 134 (1) (2016), pp. 24-36

    + The excellent performance of warfarin in the ENGAGE-AF trial may partially explain the findings and should be considered when comparing NOACs to warfarin.

    + An South Korean analysis showed consistent efficacy of edoxaban vs warfarin in reducing risk for ischemic stroke and major bleeding across different eGFR ranges.
Stroke, 50 (6) (2019), pp. 1480-1489

    + The European Medicines Agency and regulatory authorities in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have no restrictions on the use of edoxaban in patients with normal renal function, supporting its safe use in patients with eGFR >95 mL/min.

  + Recommended Doses of NOACs by Renal Function According to Randomized Controlled Trials
| | Creatinine Clearance | mL/min|
| ≥50 | 30-49 | 15-29 | <15 or Dialysis |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Dabigatran | 150 mg twice daily[a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772374722001648#tbl3fna) | 110 mg twice daily | Contraindicated | Contraindicated |

    + a:    Dose reduction criterion: 110 mg twice daily if age ≥80 years.
b:     Dose reduction criteria: 2.5 mg twice daily if ≥2 of the following: age ≥80 years, body weight ≤60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL.
c:     Dose reduction criteria: 30 mg once daily if ≥1 of the followings: body weight ≤60 kg, CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min, and concomitant use of a potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor.

## Patients With Liver Disease

  + AF +  liver disease: increased risk for bleeding and thrombosis, but there is a paucity of evidence due to generally excluded from major NOAC trials

  + All NOACs can be used in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis.

  + For patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis, dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban could be cautiously used, while {{< logseq/mark >}}rivaroxaban should not be used.{{< / logseq/mark >}}

    + rivaroxaban: clearance was decreased and plasma levels were increased to 2-fold in patients with Child-Pugh class B
Br J Clin Pharmacol, 76 (1) (2013), pp. 89-98

  + For patients with {{< logseq/mark >}}Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis, NOACs should not be used{{< / logseq/mark >}}, while well-controlled VKAs may be indicated.

  + 

## Patients With Histories of GI Bleeding

  + ARISTOTLE is the only trial that enrolled GI bleeding pts

  + In 4 clinical trials of NOACs vs VKAs, **apixaban and dabigatran 110 mg did not increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding**, but dabigatran 150 mg, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban 60 mg increased the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

  + In the Asian subanalyses of the NOAC trials, **dabigatran 150 mg and edoxaban 60 mg did not increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding**.

  + In real-world studies and meta-analyses, apixaban had the lowest risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Dabigatran and edoxaban had a neutral effect, but rivaroxaban had the highest risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

  + **For Asian patients with histories of gastrointestinal bleeding, rivaroxaban is the least preferred choice among NOACs.**

  + After active bleeding has been stopped, NOACs should be reinitiated before discharge, and proton pump inhibitors should be prescribed.

    + timing 還在討論

  + The use of antiplatelet therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids should be minimized, especially in patients with histories of major gastrointestinal bleeding.

## NOACs in Patients With Planned Invasive Procedure, Surgery, or Ablation

PAUSE study
![https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2772374722001648-gr2_lrg.jpg](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-s2772374722001648-gr2_lrg.jpg)

  + **Perioperative bridging for surgical procedures is generally not required** for patients taking NOACs.

    + warfarin: BRIDGE trial

    + post hoc ROCKET AF trial: did not change thromboembolic or bleeding rates

    + Dresden NOAC registry: did not reduce cardiovascular complications, instead increased rates of major bleeding

  + NOACs can be omitted for 1 day before a low–bleeding risk procedure and 2 days before a high–bleeding risk procedure.

  + In patients with AF who have CrCl <50 mL/min, dabigatran should be omitted for 2 days before a low–bleeding risk procedure and 4 days before a high–bleeding risk procedure.

  + NOAC regimens can be resumed on the first day after a low–bleeding risk procedure and on the second day after a high–bleeding risk procedure.

  + For AF ablation
uninterrupted NOACs vs Wafarin: similar ischemic events 
uninterrupted NOACs (esp Dabigatran) vs Wafarin: fewer bleeding complications

    + Heparin should be administered during ablation: keep act >300 seconds.

    + ELIMINATE-AF

## Patients With Planned Cardioversion

  + patients with AF or atrial flutter lasting ≥48 hours or of unknown duration, warfarin or NOAC should be used for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion

  + NOACs are as effective and safe as VKAs in planned cardioversion.

  + In combination with transesophageal echocardiography, NOACs are useful in early cardioversion.

  + patients’ histories should be thoroughly checked, including types and doses of NOACs and other modifiable risk factors for bleeding.

  + Major bleeding or life-threatening bleeding, reversal agents should be considered.

    + ### LAA occlusion

    + ### Surgical occlusion or excision of the LAA

    + Percutaneous LAA occlusion may be considered for patients who have absolute contraindications to NOACs or who have recurrent stroke or systemic embolization after NOACs.

    + Surgical occlusion or exclusion of the LAA may have an incremental effect for stroke prevention in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

    + Mini-invasive thoracoscopic LAA occlusion might be an alternative strategy for stroke prevention in Asian patients who have absolute contraindications to NOACs.

  + ## Artificial Intelligence for Stroke Prediction

    + machine learning algorithms outperformed clinical risk factor assessment tools

    + Machine learning facilitates dynamic risk stratification in the significant presence of 
multimorbidity and offers a new paradigm of “real-time” stroke risk prediction and integrated care management.
