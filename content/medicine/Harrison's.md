## Part 1 The profession of medicine

  + ## The practice of medicine


    + To wrest from nature the secrets which have perplexed philosophers in all ages, to track to their sources the causes of disease, to correlate the vast stores of knowledge, that they may be quickly available for the prevention and cure of disease—these are our ambitions.

prevention of premature death has evolved into promoting "healthspan", meaning, increase healthy lifespan,  thus "squaring the curve" of health loss during aging. ![image.png](/assets/image_1701762454866_0.png)

      + Older patients and those with a Karnofsky performance status <70 or ECOG performance status ≥3 have a poor prognosis unless the poor performance is a reversible consequence of the tumor.

    + Only stop virus replication Antiviral drugs usually do not eradicate latent viral infections, but instead usually inhibit viral replication; thus, when treatment is stopped, the virus can reactivate and replicate again.

    + RNA virus are more common to mutate and cause resistance -> use **Combination therapy**, but drug-resistant DNA viruses are a greater problem in immunocompromised patients

ls-type:: annotation
hl-page:: 1520
hl-color:: yellow



    + VZV is a member of the family Herpesviridae,  lipid envelope surrounding a nucleocapsid with icosahedral symmetry, double-stranded DNA.

    + varicella (chickenpox) - benign illness of childhood characterized by an exanthematous vesicular rash.

    + herpes zoster (shingles) - dermatomal vesicular rash and is usually associated with severe pain

    + #### Pathogenesis:

      + **Primary infection**: respiratory route, seeding of the lymphatic/ reticuloendothelial system and development of viremia. chickenpox 會產生 diffuse 水泡(with multinucleated giant cells)，the vesicles will than rupture (contain infectious virus) or reabsorbed.

**Recurrent infection**: Mechanism unknown. Latent in dorsal root ganglia. Latent virus has been detected in sensory(dorsal, cranial, and enteric) ganglia.
ls-type:: annotation
hl-page:: 1520
hl-color:: green

In immunocompromised patients VZV may replicate in lung or brain.
Pulmonary: ((65d44222-4984-4557-93ff-c3ba6dd8d4bc))
CNS infection: ((65d441f6-edd8-4bab-ac9e-735cb6760581))

    + #### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS


      + rash + recent exposure

      + 類似的rash: These rashes are more commonly morbilliform with a hemorrhagic component rather than vesicular or vesiculopustular.


        + disseminated HSV infection in patients with atopic dermatitis

        + disseminated vesiculopapular lesions sometimes associated with coxsackievirus infection, echovirus infection, or atypical measles.

      + Rickettsialpox Rickettsial Diseases

: distinguished easily by detection of the “herald spot” at the site of the mite bite and the development of a more pronounced headache. 
Serologic testing is also useful in differentiating rickettsialpox from varicella and can confirm susceptibility in adults unsure of their chickenpox history.

      + Monkeypox virus
hl-page:: 1535
ls-type:: annotation
 should be considered in travelers returning from endemic areas

      + smallpox : lesions are larger than those of chickenpox and are all at the same stage of evolution at any given time

    + LABORATORY FINDINGS:


      + Definite diagnosis:  either
1. isolation of VZV in susceptible tissue-culture cell lines
2. seroconversion or a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum specimens
3. detection of VZV DNA by PCR

      + rapid impression can be obtained by a Tzanck smear: low sensitivity 60%

      + The most frequently employed serologic tools for assessing host response are the **immunofluorescent detection of antibodies to VZV membrane antigens**, the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) test, immune adherence hemagglutination, and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The FAMA test and the ELISA appear to be most sensitive.

    + TREATMENT


      + **Prevent complications**: 簡短指甲避免感染


        + Pruritis: topical dressing, Tepid water baths and wet compresses are better than drying lotions

      + DO NOT USE Aspirin ‼️ -> Reye’s syndrome

      + Acyclovir (800 mg PO five times daily), valacyclovir (1 g TID), or famciclovir (250 mg TID) * 5–7 days for adolescents and adults with chickenpox of **≤24 h duration**.

  + 446 Peripheral Neuropathy


    + Peripheral nerves 三個組成： sensory, motor and autonomic

    + Nerves 依解剖有三種： large myelinated, small myelinated, and small unmyelinated.

    + Motor: large myelinated. 
Sensory: 大直徑－本體，觸覺 小直徑－溫痛
AUtonomic: small diameter

    + Peripheral neuropathies 又分成影響 cell body (e.g., neuronopathy or ganglionopathy), myelin (myelinopathy), 或是 axon (axonopathy).

General approach: 三個重點 1.找到位置 2.找到原因 3.後續治療
但一半的病人找不到原因 － idiopathic or cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN)
![image.png](/assets/image_1701945929774_0.png)

病史＋理學檢查七大問題
1. 包含哪些系統：motor, sensory, autonomic 或混合 
{{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}大部分是sensory
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}
2. 無力的分佈：近遠端？對稱？
3. 影響 upper motor neuron?
4. Sensory 的特型：怎樣的痛 （本觸溫痛）
5. 時序：發生多久了？單次/多次
6. 遺傳性
7. 其他醫療問題：癌症，DM, autoimmune, Infection, connective tissue disease. Drugs, toxins.
![image.png](/assets/image_1701859078091_0.png)

        + Autonomic dysfunction in the absence of diabetes should alert the clinician to the possibility of amyloid polyneuropathy

        + Symmetric proximal and distal weakness is the hallmark of acquired immune demyelinating polyneuropathies, both the acute form (Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS]) and the chronic form (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [CIDP])

        + the most likely cause of small-fiber neuropathies (溫痛), when one is identified, is diabetes mellitus (DM) or glucose intoler- ance. Amyloid neuropathy should be considered as well in such cases

Electrodiagnostic studies usually include [NCS]({{< ref "/pages/NCS" >}}) and EMG study
![image.png](/assets/image_1701859447624_0.png)

        + NCS 可以區分 axonal degeneration 或是 segmental demyelination

        + Axon degeneration: 振幅下降，遠端延遲跟傳導速度不變，EMG 出現 fibrillations

        + Segmental demyelination: 振幅不變，遠端延遲增加，傳導速度變慢, EMG 沒有 fibrillations

        + nonuniform slowing of conduction velocity, conduction block, or temporal dispersion : 
acquired demyelinating neuropathy (e.g., GBS or CIDP)

        + Autonomic studies 看小神經 myelinated (A-delta) or unmyelinated (C) - pure small-fiber neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy 的 NCS 是正常的

      + Lab: generalized symmetric peripheral neuropathy, 抽 CBC, E8, 肝腎, Glc, HbA1c, 尿生化, thyroid, B12, folate, ESR, rheumatoid factor, ANA, 蛋白電泳SPEP, immunoelectrophoresis or immu- nofixation, 尿 Bence Jones protein.

        + If 懷疑 amyloidosis , 做 light chain,  kappa/lambda ratio 看 monoclonal gammopathy.

        + Acquired demyelinating neuropathies and M-spikes : 做骨掃描 看 osteosclerotic or lytic lesions.

        + Monoclonal gammopathy - 考慮做 bone marroaw

        + Painful sensory neuropathies: 必須做 oral glucose tolerance test 就算空腹血糖, HbA1c 正常 （1/3 會異常）

        + Ｍononeuropathy multiplex pattern of involvement： 做 vasculitis workup, 抽ANCA, cryoglobulins, hepatitis serology, Western blot for Lyme disease, HIV, CMV titer

        + severe painful sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy and alopecia— thallium
severe painful sensorimotor neuropathy with or without gastrointestinal [GI] disturbance and Mee’s lines—arsenic
wrist or finger extensor weakness and anemia with basophilic stippling of red blood cells—lead

      + 懷疑 GBS or CIDP 
1. 要做 lumbar puncture 看 elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein. 自發性的 GBS 跟 CIDP 不會 CSF pleocytosis. If cells are present, consider HIV infection, Lyme disease , sarcoidosis , or lymphomatous or leukemic infiltration of nerve roots. 
2. 有些肝功能會異常：check for hepatitis B HCV, HIV, CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. 
3. Axonal GBS (by EMG/NCS) 病人或是有共病的  (e.g., unexplained abdominal pain, psychiatric illness, significant autonomic dysfunction), it is reasonable to screen for porphyria.
